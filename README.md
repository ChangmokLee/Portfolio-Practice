# Overview
As a software engineer eager to further my learning, I created a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python. This classic program is often used as a starting point for beginners learning a new programming language, and it serves as a fundamental introduction to basic syntax and program structure.

# Description
My software is a single Python script that prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console. It is a basic program with just one line of code that demonstrates the basic syntax of a Python program. This program does not have any complex functionality and is purely intended as a learning exercise for beginners to understand how to write and run a simple Python program.

# Purpose
The purpose of creating this software was to practice my skills as a software engineer and familiarize myself with Python syntax. It allowed me to understand the basic structure of a Python program, learn how to run Python code, and gain a foundational understanding of Python's print statement.

# Development Environment
To develop this software, I used a text editor of my choice, such as VSCode or Sublime Text, to write the Python code. I also used a Python interpreter or compiler to run the program and see the output on the console.

# Programming Language
I used Python, a popular and versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python is widely used in various domains, including web development, data science, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence, making it a valuable skill for software engineers.

# Useful Websites
During the development of this project, I found the following websites helpful:

Python Official Documentation: The official documentation for Python, which provided detailed information on Python syntax, functions, and libraries.
Python Software Foundation: The official website of the Python Software Foundation, which offers a wealth of resources, tutorials, and community forums for Python developers.
Stack Overflow: A popular online community for programmers where I could find answers to my coding questions related to Python and troubleshoot any issues I encountered.
GeeksforGeeks: A website that provides comprehensive tutorials and articles on Python programming, including examples and practical exercises to help me deepen my understanding of Python concepts.
